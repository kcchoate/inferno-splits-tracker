# Inferno Splits Tracker
## Requirements
This plugin currently requires the "Inferno Splits Timer" to be installed and running.

## Functionality
This plugin is designed to help track your inferno wave splits over time. At this time, the plugin offers the ability
to save your splits to a file  (located at `.runelite/infernoSplitsTracker`) and to upload them to Discord using a
Discord webhook.

## Future Plans
### Soon
- Add Tests
- Add Clipboard as a target for splits
### Later
- Add some level of historical tracking to inferno wave splits. I currently plan to accomplish this by storing a 
player's best ever time to a split, best time to a split on a completed kc, and the time to the split on the user's PB
run. Putting this in the built-in configuration would be nice to allow for new users to put in what info they already
know
- Add in-game chat notifications on splits which compare the split to previous splits
- Add discord notification for new PB
